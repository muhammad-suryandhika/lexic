Lexic: The Android Word Game
============================

Lexic is a word game that is available on the Android platform. Players are 
given 3 minutes to find as many words as possible on a grid of random letters.

Lexic Features:
 -4x4 and 5x5 game boards
 -Online multiplayer gaming
 -A dictionary of 77,000+ words
 -UK and US dictionaries


Requirements
------------
At this point, Lexic only runs on the Android mobile device platform and 
requires and Android SDK to compile.  More information about the Android SDK
is available at:

http://code.google.com/android/


Compiling
---------

The build.xml file should have everything that is required for compilation.
It assumes that the android sdk is available in a directory called 
"android_sdk" that is located in the directory above the android source tree.
The "android-sdk" property in the ant file can be altered to change this.
